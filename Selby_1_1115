the three types of novice programmers are:
1. Mover
2. Tinker
3. Stopper
The movers and Tinkerers were more successfull due to the fact that they keep working on something, or work past a problem rather 
than sitting on the issue and putting in no effort to try and fix the problem, or mistake they made.
